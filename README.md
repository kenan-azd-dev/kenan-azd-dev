## Hello, World!
I'm Kenan, a Flutter developer based in Syria. 

## About me:
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology Engineering at Damascus University and building beautiful and functional mobile apps with Flutter. While Flutter is my main squeeze, I'm also comfortable with the classics: Python , HTML & CSS , and JavaScript (Full-Stack potential?) ✨.
